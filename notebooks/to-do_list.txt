After completion of project:

EDA:

- EDA for NLP

Pre-processing:

- lowercase the text
- potentially look in to lemmatization (normalization)
- clean noise from the data
- remove stopwords

Modelling:

- review the use of NLP - could we instead look at key words within the variables? This might be a better option for the title variable
- can we use neural networks?

- geographical map showing where the model has worked well

EDA:

- try to visualise how much information we could potentially be losing out on by not using review data
- timeseries visualisations - off-topic but could be interesting as a result of Covid impact on 2020
